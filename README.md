# Sign-Up Form

Interactive sign-up form created with [Spline.design](https://spline.design/). Spline allows for the creation of interactive 3D scenes and models, as it is built on top of [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
The sign-up form also incorporates basic client-side password validation using JavaScript (*not a replacement for server-side validation!*).
